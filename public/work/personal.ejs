            I created this application to see if I could find a wider audience for
            my photography and increase the number of followers of
            <a href="http://bobhumphreyphotography.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">
              my tumblr site</a>.

            There are a number of popular tumblr sites  that showcase the work of
            unknown photographers.  Many of these sites allow you to submit your
            work to them for consideration and possible posting.
            For lack of a better term, I call these sites Galleries and keep a
            <a href="http://photography.bobhumphrey.org/galleries" target="_blank">list of them here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When adding new photos to my tumblr, I also add them to this application.
            I then use the application to keep track of when I send an image to a
            gallery for possible publication.  I maintain a
            <a href="http://photography.bobhumphrey.org/submissions" target="_blank">list of these submissions</a>,
            along with whether or not the photo was actually accepted.
            Finally, for each photo, I track the number of notes received,
            which is tumblr-speak for  the number of times a post is either liked
            or reblogged by someone else.
