            This is a new version of Randall Library’s search box that looks
            across multiple systems, presenting the top results in separate
            categories on a single page.  This kind of search application has
            proven to be popular at many of the nation’s top academic libraries,
            including UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, Princeton, and Cornell. The name
            has been borrowed from Japanese takeout meals and lunch boxes,
            where each individual item is placed in its own individual
            compartment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patrons enter search terms in a simple box, and then the application
            makes calls to various sources, including the library catalog,
            Google, and Summon Serial Solutions, a service that provides access
            to scholarly articles, journals, newspapers, and magazines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple Ajax calls are employed to fetch the information behind the
            scenes, and then the results are presented in a way that encourages
            additional searching and deeper exploration.  The application is
            written as a Drupal module so that it integrates seamlessly with the
            rest of the library website.
          </p>
        <p>
          Search results for books, e-books, videos, and music come from Randall
          Library’s own catalog, but we were unable to produce results that
          were an exact match to our other catalog searches.  The reason for
          this is that the catalog software is provided by an outside vendor
          who doesn’t share their proprietary search algorithms.  We solved
          this problem by screen-scraping our own catalog pages, with the payoff
          being consistent results every time.

          Like most academic libraries, Randall Library had a number of rooms
          set aside for groups to get together and study.  But access to these
          rooms was somewhat difficult.  Since they were available on a first
          come, first serve basis, and there was a high demand for these rooms,
          it was very difficult for groups of students to make plans ahead of
          time to secure a quiet, private study space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The library wanted a scheduling application that patrons could use to
          reserve a group study room at a future time.  It had to be so easy to
          use that students could manage the whole process themselves, with
          little to no assistance from the already busy library staff.  The
          application needed to implement library specific rules, such as one
          reservation per day per student, and a two hour maximum time limit.
          It also had to work seamlessly with the rest of the library web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created the Room Reservation Drupal module to meet these
          requirements. An easy to use calendar shows students what rooms are
          available on any given day and time.  Clicking an open slot on the
          calendar brings up a simple form that is used to complete the
          reservation.  Confirmation and reminder messages are emailed to the
          student, or sent as a message to the student’s cell phone.  In the
          three years since the application was launched, it has been
          successfully used to make more than 59,000 reservations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The module was coded in a way so that it could be modified and
          extended several times.  There are now a number of versions of this
          application running throughout the library:
          <ul class="normal">
            <li>
              The original version of the application runs within the library
              desktop website.
            </li>
            <li>
              A second version runs on the library mobile website.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a touchscreen version that runs within the library’s
              information kiosk.
            </li>
            <li>
              A display only version shows currently open rooms on a prominently
              displayed monitor.
            </li>
            <li>
              And a version customized for the library’s Technology Enhanced
              Collaboration Space runs on an iPad kiosk outside of that
              workspace.
            </li>
          </ul>

        WorldCat is a large database of library content and services that is
        often used by students and researchers to locate books, music, videos,
        and other items.  When Randall Library switched from WorldCat Local to
        Summon as its primary resource database, we still wanted a way to
        provide support to those patrons who would be continuing to use WorldCat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solution was to create a bookmarklet that makes it easier for
        researchers to get copies of materials found with WorldCat from Randall
        Library. If the user is on any WorldCat title page, they can click the
        bookmarklet, and the application will then search Randall Library’s
        catalog to see if the item can be located.
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the item is found, the user will be taken to the library’s catalog
      page, which has information on where to locate the item inside the
      library.  If the item is not found, the user is redirected to Randall’s
      interlibrary loan page.  A form is provided to request the item from
      interlibrary loan, but the form is already completely filled out using
      the information that was contained in WorldCat. All the patron has to do
      is submit the form, and then Randall will borrow the item from another
      library and make it available to the user.

        Randall Library maintains 124 PCs for use by students in its Learning
        Commons.  There are a number of challenges associated with this.  How
        do we provide usage statistics to justify the expense of providing this
        equipment?  How do we know when additional hardware needs to be p
        urchased?  How do we direct students to open machines?   How can we
        provide daily maintenance to this equipment in as efficient a manner as
        possible?
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/reports/computer-availability"
        target="_blank">open source software created by North Carolina State
        University</a> and <a href="http://www.labstats.com/" target="_blank">
          proprietary reporting tools purchased from Labstats</a>,
          we were able to create maps and reports showing current and historical
          usage.  However, when Labstats increased their prices for a new version
          of their software, which also required the purchase and maintenance of a
          dedicated server, I was asked to provide a more cost effective in-house
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to build a database of PC usage for each machine and provide
          graphical and table-based reporting for all of our resources on an
          hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  This information is used to
          demonstrate the service level being provided by the library, as well as
          to plan for future expansion of this service.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also created reports that show machines where no one has logged on or
          logged off during the past 6, 12, and 24 hours.  This information is used
          by our technical staff to quickly identify and resolve computer hardware
          and software problems as soon as they arise.

        Collection development at an academic library is a complicated process.
        Materials are acquired at Randall Library for over 40 different
        departments, based in part on requests from faculty, students, and
        librarians.  Budgets are developed on an annual basis, and purchases
        need to be tracked against these budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information for managing this process had been housed in the
        library’s ILS (integrated library system), but not in a way that was
        practical for using and making decisions.   Also, much of this data was
        lost over the course of the accounting cycle once certain fund activity
        reports had been run.
      </p>
      <p>
        This application was built to collect the required information on a
        daily basis and store it in a local database where it would not be
        deleted.  Then reports were built to display the information in a way
        that clarified what items were being purchased, how much money was
        being spent, and what funds were available for future purchases.

        Librarians (administrators, politicians, and a lot of other people) are
        constantly asking the question:  What value is being provided by the
        academic librarian in the Internet Age?

        Randall Library, like every other library, knows that it has to make a
        strong case to justify its considerable annual budget.  This is being
        done in a lot of different ways.  One small part of this effort is the
        Library Dashboard.  The dashboard is a visual presentation of the use,
        activity, and resources available in the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built the dashboard inside of the library’s Drupal website using PHP
        and the Highcharts JavaScript library.  Where possible, the graphs are
        updated in real time using current data from the library’s various
        database applications.

        Students come to college with a dependency on the Google search box.
        They’ve spent their entire lives navigating the internet via a keyword
        or two.  Suddenly they are faced with more challenging research
        projects, and how do you help them to develop a more deliberate,
        effective approach to finding information?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Research Strategy application is Randall Library’s attempt to an
        answer this question.  It involves following a series of steps to
        produce a search statement that can be successfully used to locate
        relevant scholarly material.  The process is simple enough to work, but
        complicated enough to be a little difficult to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It originally began as a paper form, but that proved to be confusing to
        use, so I coded a Drupal module with ten screens and lots of buttons to
        navigate through all the various steps and choices.  This too proved
        difficult to teach and learn.  So I then created a single page
        JavaScript application.  Students are no longer bounced from one screen
        to another.  Instead, everything is presented on one page just when it’s
        needed, along with plenty of explanation and support.  The application
        adjusts itself to every keystroke and mouse click, gently guiding the
        student from start to finish.

        Randall Library had a lot of reasons for wanting to migrate our
        applications from Windows to Linux servers: better performance, better
        security, and campus IT would help with software updates and patches.
        The one thing we didn’t have is any experience with Linux.
      </p>
      <p>
        I volunteered for a pilot project to migrate twenty or so internal
        applications to servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  The first
        step was to set up a test server on an old machine that wasn’t being
        used for anything else.  I learned how to install CentOs, Apache, MySQL,
        and PHP, set up the firewall tables and backups, and I then moved all
        the applications over to the new server for testing.  The project went
        well enough that I have since built a second server and migrated another
        set of applications away from Windows.

        The subject experts and liaison librarians at Randall Library create
        research guides to provide students with an overview of some of the best
        materials available for a given topic.  These guides are created using
        the Drupal content management system, but Drupal does not provide all of
        the functionality required to customize these pages the way our
        librarians wanted.  I wrote the e-resource administration module to add
        the requested new features to what was already available through Drupal.

        There is always plenty of Drupal maintenance that needs to be done
        at Randall Library.  We normally have between 15 and 20 sites running
        for both patrons and internal library staff.

        An example of a typical request involved creating a report of information
        resources assigned to two or more research guides.  A sample from
        the report is shown above.  Due to the complex nature of Drupal,
        simple-sounding requests can often be extremely challenging.
        The information required for the report was buried somewhere
        within the database's 270 tables and 3 million plus records,
        and nowhere was there documentation that would help me figure out
        where it was all at.

        for a look at the notes I made tracking down the relationships
        in the database.
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also asked to do things like:
      <ul class="normal">
        <li>
          customize interfaces
        </li>
        <li>
          hide sensitive data or prevent data being collected that would
          violate our privacy guidelines
        </li>
        <li>
          fix Drupal bugs
        </li>
        <li>
          make Drupal do what it was never intended to do!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course many changes went way beyond simple reports and customizations.
      For these, I would write custom modules making full use of the
      <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal" target="_blank">
        Drupal programming API
      </a>
      .

        The library created an electronic information kiosk to help patrons
        find people, places, resources, and events within the

        being used the way we envisioned.

              When Randall Library decided to switch providers for its discovery
              service, thousands of links on our website needed to be changed.
              I created a Drupal module that examined every record in our
              database so that each link could be updated.  However, there were
              still many links that were out of our reach that could not be
              changed: on other websites, in student bookmarks, and on class
              syllabi.  For these, I built the Link Translator as another
              Drupal module.  Just paste or type in the old link and an updated
              one is displayed.

              So here’s a task that’s not a lot of fun.  Once a week, someone in
              the library has to find all the books and other materials that
              have been borrowed and are now more than two weeks overdue.  Then
              they have to figure out how much each of these items would cost to
              replace, and enter that information into the library’s computer
              system.  That way, if the item is not returned, the library knows
              how much to charge the patron to replace it.   The first step in
              this process is to find the overdue items, and that’s what the
              Price List application does.

              I built the Randall Library Staff site using Drupal 6.  The
              site is used by library personnel to do things like request funds
              for travel or training, respond to internal surveys, and recognize
              coworkers for special work or service.  In 2015 I converted the

              into a series of steps, each with its own completion date.  I
              added additional customization requested by Randall Library,

              This project creates a local database of library inventory,
              indexed by call number.  It involves downloading a million plus

                Innovative Interfaces Inc
              </a>
              , using the API provided by the vendor.
              Since transactions with Sierra timeout after several thousand
              records have been received, this process has been built as a series
              of batch jobs that repeat every five minutes beginning at 1 in
              the morning.  The project includes online reports for monitoring
              the batch jobs and viewing the resulting data.  It is the
              foundation for a number of new applications to be built using this
              data.

              From time to time, library patrons borrow books and movies and
              CDs--and then they never return them.  You get fines and penalties
              for doing this, of course, along with having to pay the replacement
              cost for the lost items, but all too often none of these get paid
              either.  So once a month, we run the <strong>transfers application
              </strong>.  It searches through the library records and finds
              patrons who have had outstanding fines for a long period of time.
              It then transfers these fines to their university account.  Once
              that happens, students are unable to sign up for classes or
              graduate until their debts have been paid.

              Randall Library librarians create subject guides that include some
              of the best research resources on various topics.  The last time
              I counted, there were almost 250 of these guides.  We created the
              Guides website with the Drupal Content Management System to make it
              easy for the librarians to put these together.  My boss built the
              site using a number of Drupal modules.  I added custom programming
              to solve problems and add additional features.  My list of tasks
              included things like:  hide global description if custom
              description exists, remove the option to save the guide as a new
              default, make proxied links clickable, figure out why the chat
              widgets are crashing.

              Sometimes patrons get set up twice in the integrated library
              system by mistake.  When this occurs, a lot of bad things happen.
              This application searches the database and finds these duplicates,

              be prevented.

              available through the standard user interface.  For example,
              before my performance review at the end of the year, I would run
              a custom report of everything I accomplished during the previous
              twelve months.  The Asana API can be slow to run, returning only a
              small number of records for each request.  So I built a batch job
              that runs every evening.  It fetches all the records and loads
              them into a local database.  Then, whenever a report is needed, it
              is available instantly.

              Randall Library makes a variety of computers available to help
              students with their studies, including desktop and laptop PCs and
              Macs.  The Computer & Laptop Availability Map shows the location
              of the desktop machines along with their availability status.  But
              we also wanted to show how many laptops were available to be
              borrowed.  That information, like just about everything else in
              the library, was stored in the Sierra integrated library system,
              in a vendor’s database that would not normally be available to the
              library’s Drupal website.  To bridge this gap, I created a Node.JS
              application that took a request from the Drupal site and made a
              call out to the vendor’s database.  It then returned the requested
              information—a count of the available laptop computers—and returned
              that information to Drupal so that it could be displayed in the
              library’s website.  The same Node.JS application is called by a
              number of other applications running throughout the library to
              display this availability information on monitors to the students.

              Everything you need to run an academic library is stored in the
              library’s ILS—the integrated library system.  Whenever materials
              are added to the collection or borrowed or returned, the
              transactions are captured in the ILS.  It’s very easy to get
              information into the system, but getting information back out is
              often another matter.  Reports can be run, but creating them can
              be a slow and time-consuming chore.  That’s why the Item Status
              Report was created.   It takes some of the most commonly requested
              reports and automates them so that they can be run with a couple
              quick choices and the click of a button.

              Whenever the library removes items from its collections, this
              information needs to be sent to the vendor that handles the
              library discovery service, so that students and researchers don’t
              think we have items that we actually do not.  This application finds the
              deleted items and sends an update to our vendor.

              The library’s interlibrary loan form was a mess.  It had way too
              many fields because it needed different information depending on
              the type of patron using the form: faculty, staff, graduate student,
              undergraduate student, or distance (online) student.  I added
              JavaScript code to hide and reveal the fields that were
              appropriate to each type of user.

              The library systems department uses the open source
              <a href="http://osticket.com/" target="_blank">osTicket</a>
              application to track user problems and change requests.  I
              migrated the library’s software from an older version to the
              current one and reapplied lots of customizations that had
              previously been made.  I also added new customizations as
              requested, including things like letting users create tickets by
              submitting an email rather than filling out a form.
